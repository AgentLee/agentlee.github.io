			  My point is, Disney is spending a lot (understatement) on these expansions/revamps while Universal is spending like half of that and is CAPITALIZING BIG TIME. For Disney to invest 3 BILLION dollars on revitalizing the studios, they must have something that they believe will steal all those tourists from Universal/Harry Potter to Disney. And that is:
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Star Wars.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Star Wars has been a quintesential part of pop culture for 40+ years now. It has fans that were adults in the 70s, kids in the 70s, and kids that unfortunately grew up with The Phantom Menace (me). Nevertheless, Star Wars is an incredible phenomenon and you can expect Disney to make an announcement of Star Wars Land in some shape or form in the upcoming D23 event in August. There's no better time for Disney to announce something like this than now because of the new trilogy kicking off in December, a slew of announced anthology films and comics, and the new Star Wars Rebels winning the hearts of a new generation of Star Wars fans.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  I stumbled upon another article a few weeks ago as to the VAST amount of land that the studios have at its current state. We all know that Lights, Motors, Action! is on its last life and will be going away probably in the next year, the Backlot Tour is closed, and the Streets of America is just kind of there. This area has connection to Star Tours. So there is definitely something going on over there. HOWEVER, this does mean Muppets Vision 3D might be closing its doors and Pizza Planet might be rethemed to a new restaurant, maybe. I'm writing this based on my memory of the park without references, I apologize. That whole area can be used for a Star Wars Land. Now the Backlot Tour connects to Pixar Place and there's already a third track being built in the sound stage right next to Toy Story Mania. So it could also be possible, they're going to do a Pixar Place expansion.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  But what about the whole Animation Courtyard area? The Magic of Disney Animation closed a few days ago and the Voyage of the Little Mermaid will probably go soon along with One Man's Dream. This area can be used for Pixar as well. There is a lot of land to work with at the studios.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  I'm excited to see what's coming. I loved the Animation Academy. My cousins and I started going there before there was a 2 class wait and you can just draw character after character. So an expansion of that would be EXCELLENT. It is an insanely popular attraction and Disney would be soooooo wrong if they killed it completely.
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  I will talk more about the expansion as more news roll in.
