				<h2>RU Studying</h2>
				<h4>Web App [Python/Flask] <small>Summer 2015</small></h4>
				<h5 class = "project-type">Personal Project</h5>

				<p>
					During operating hours, it's pretty difficult to find a classroom to study in. There always seems to be a lecture going on when you want to study in a room. RU Studying solves this problem.
				</p>					

				<p>
					RU Studying parses the data obtained from the schedule of classes from the <a href = "http://api.rutgers.edu/" target = "blank">Rutgers API</a>. Students choose the campus they are in (1), then students pick the building on campus (2), and finally students can view a list of classrooms that are available (based off the current time) for studying (3).
				</p>

				<hr>

				<!-- <p>
					Finding a good place to study was one of the biggest problems during my undergrad. Writing out problems and pseudocode with classmates was always good to walk through thought processes and such.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Cave was a place where CS students can collaborate and do homework, but it was always too cramped. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I came up with this idea either my sophomore or junior year but never got around to it untill the summer of 2015.

					The goal of this projet was to write a REST application that queries, adds, and modifies a gradebook (JSON). 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>POST</code> adds students to database</li>
					<li><code>GET</code> queries information about a student</li>
					<li><code>DELETE</code> deletes based on input parameters</li>
					<li><code>UPDATE</code> updates student grades based on input parameters</li>
					<li><code>LIST</code> shows all the students' information</li>

				</h5>

				<p>
					The goal of this assignment was to create a simple shell that can carry out various unix commands. We were given a text file with every word from Moby Dick and we had to perform functions on the text file.
				</p>

				<p>
					Implemented various functions such as:
					<ul>
						<li><code>ls</code></li> lists everything in the directory
						<li><code>ws</code></li> counts lines, words, and characters
						<li><code>cat</code></li> prints contents of a file in the terminal
						<li><code>tr</code></li> translates letters from uppercase to lowercase and vice versa
						<li><code>sed</code></li> runs sed to delete
						<li><code>sort</code></li> sorts output
						<li><code>uniq</code></li> combines adjacent lines 
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					Example Commands: 
					<ul>
						<li><code>ls | wc -l</code></li>
						Number of files and directories in current directory.
						<li><code>cat moby.txt</code></li>
						Outputs moby.txt into terminal.
						<li><code>cat moby.txt |tr A-Z a-z|tr -C a-z '\n' |sed  '/^$/d' |sort|uniq -c|sort -nr|sed 10q</code></li>
						Finds top ten words in moby.txt and count occurance.
					</ul>

				<h2>Multithreaded Book Order System</h2>
				<h4>[C] <small>Fall 2014</small></h4>

					Course: <a target = "blank" href = "https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/course/systems-programming">Systems Programming (CS214)</a>
					<br>
					Teammate: Nikki Nagar
				</h5>

				<p>
					For this assignment, we were using the full multithreading capabilities of C to process a copious amount of orders (text file). The multithreading examples that we were given were fairly simple. The concept was easy to understand. <i>You lock the data you want to work on and release it when it's done.</i> But I remember this assignment incredibly difficult. Multithreading is no joke. We still managed to grind it out and finish the assignment.

				</h5>

				<p>
					SPN's are given to students who want to enroll in a course but the course has reached its its registration cap. This application was to allow students to login with their RUID and password, find the course they want, and apply for the SPN. Professors can also login with their RUID and password, check the waiting list for SPN's, check each student's grades/transcripts, and determine if the student receives it or not. Admins have access to all aspects of the system.			
				</p>
				<p>
					Our system used Java for the backend and MySQL for the database. We developed the schema, database, and website for the entire application.
